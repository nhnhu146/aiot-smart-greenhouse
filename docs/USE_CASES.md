2. User defines trigger conditions (e.g., temperature > 25Â°C)
3. User specifies actions (e.g., turn on fan)
4. User sets rule priority and schedule
5. System validates and saves automation rule
6. System begins monitoring for trigger conditions

**Alternative Flows**:
- If conflicting rules exist, system requests prioritization
- User can test rules in simulation mode

**Postconditions**:
- Automation rule is active
- System monitors conditions continuously

### UC-04: Receive and Manage Alerts

**Actor**: All Users

**Description**: Receive notifications when conditions exceed thresholds

**Preconditions**:

**Main Flow**:
1. System detects threshold violation
2. System generates alert with severity level
3. System sends notifications based on user preferences
4. User receives alert via email and/or dashboard
5. User acknowledges alert
6. User takes corrective action if needed

**Alternative Flows**:
- If alert persists, system escalates to higher severity
- User can temporarily disable specific alert types

**Postconditions**:
- Alert is logged in system
- User is informed of system status

### UC-05: Analyze Historical Data

**Actor**: Greenhouse Owner/Manager

**Description**: Review historical data to optimize greenhouse operations

**Preconditions**:
- Historical data is available
- User has analytical access

**Main Flow**:
1. User accesses data analysis interface

3. System generates charts and reports
4. User identifies trends and patterns
5. User exports data for external analysis

**Alternative Flows**:
- User can compare data across different time periods
- System provides automated insights and recommendations

**Postconditions**:
- User gains operational insights
- Data export is available for further analysis

### UC-06: Manage User Access

**Actor**: Greenhouse Owner/Manager

**Description**: Control user access and permissions

**Preconditions**:
- Administrator is authenticated
- User management interface is accessible

**Main Flow**:
1. Administrator accesses user management
2. Administrator creates/modifies user accounts
3. Administrator sets role-based permissions
4. Administrator configures notification preferences
5. System updates access controls

**Alternative Flows**:
- Administrator can temporarily disable user accounts
- System requires confirmation for permission changes

**Postconditions**:
- User access is properly controlled
- Changes are logged for audit trail

## Advanced Use Cases

<!-- ### UC-07: Predictive Analytics

**Actor**: System (Automated)

**Description**: Use machine learning to predict optimal conditions

**Main Flow**:
1. System analyzes historical data patterns
2. System identifies optimal condition ranges
3. System predicts future environmental needs
4. System suggests automation rule adjustments
