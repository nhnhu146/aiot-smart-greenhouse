## Color Strategy
- **Dark text (#2c3e50, #1565c0, #d32f2f)** on light backgrounds
- **Light backgrounds (#f8f9fa, #e3f2fd, #ffebee)** instead of dark
- **Strong borders** for element definition
- **High contrast ratios** for accessibility
- **Email client compatibility** for both light/dark modes

## Testing
- ✅ Templates compiled successfully
- ✅ Email sent to vttu135@gmail.com for visual verification
- ✅ No white-on-white visibility issues remaining

## Next Steps
1. User should check email visibility in both light/dark email clients
2. Verify readability across different email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
